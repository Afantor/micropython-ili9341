# Micropython Driver for ILI9341 display

<<<<<<< HEAD
This has been tested on an M5Stack module using the standard esp32 micropython port. The default font is the Adafruit glcdfont and additional fonts can be generated by a very slightly modified version of Peter Hinch's font-to-py program which includes a function in font file to return the width of a string.
